# Practical API Guidelines - Maturity level One "Must have" - Code Samples
Code samples for maturity level One "Must have".

These include:
- URL NAMING
	+ api name 
	+ plural for collections
	+ no verbs in URLs
	+ lower case URLs
	+ "-" for better readibility
	- command as part of the URL (wip)

- VERSIONING in the path + ApiVersion attribute

- DATA CONTRACTS
	+ camlCase (dotnetcore >2 has camlCase by default)
	- dateFormat (wip)

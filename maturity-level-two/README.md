1. [Writing Open API Specifications](#writing-open-api-specifications)

## Writing solid OpenAPI Specifications
Writing OpenAPI specs is easy, writing good OpenAPI specs is a different story.

[Maturity level one covered how you can document & generate OpenAPI specifications](./../maturity-level-one#document-your-apis), however that is only the start.

You should:
- Add your OpenAPI specs to source control given this is part of your application
- Validate changes to your OpenAPI specs to avoid specification violations ([user guide](docs/validating-open-api-specs.md))
